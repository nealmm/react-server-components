# React Server Components (without a Framework)

An example of a React application implementing server components without a framework.

See my [blog post](https://nealmm.github.io/posts/react-server-components/) explaining how this works.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to build client bundles.
3. Run `npm start` to start local server on `localhost:3003`.
